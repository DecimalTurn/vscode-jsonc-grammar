# vscode-jsonc-syntax-highlighting

The purpose of this repo is to hold an up-to-date copy of [JSONC.tmLanguage.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/json/syntaxes/JSONC.tmLanguage.json) (see inside `/syntaxes`) from the official VS Code repo with [small modifications](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/vscode-jsonc-syntax-highlighting/blob/b375c20466d52b8476e470f664b74ea050cc7cc8/sync.py#L18). It is meant to be used by github-linguist or any other repo that wants to keep track of that file, but doesn't wish to include a whole git submodule of the VS Code repo in their own project.
