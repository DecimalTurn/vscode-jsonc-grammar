# vscode-jsonc-syntax-highlighting

The purpose of this repo is to hold an up-to-date copy of [JSONC.tmLanguage.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode/main/extensions/json/syntaxes/JSONC.tmLanguage.json) (see inside /syntaxes) from the official VS Code repo. It is meant to be used by github-linguist or any other repo that wants to keep track of that file, but doesn't wish to include a whole git submodule of the VS Code repo in their own project.
